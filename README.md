# Scripts

### a Collection of CLI tool i have made

---

programs don't have the extension, just add it back, language can prob be read from the shebang

## **To Use**

run the setup file to turn files executable
``` bash
./.setup.sh
```

then add the path to scripts to your shells config: bash *~/.bashrc* or zsh *~/.zshrc*
``` bash
export PATH="$HOME/replace/with/path/to/scripts:$PATH"
```
you should now be able to run the files as CLI tools
